## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Off-Session Payments
Payment methods are saved with the ability to charge automatically without user present. This is **critical** for monthly recurring payments.

### 2. ✅ Smart Optimization Algorithm
When a server is overfunded (total pledges exceed cost), the algorithm automatically reduces everyone's payment proportionally. This saves money for pledgers!

**Example:**
- Server cost: $50/month
- Total pledges: $100/month (10 people × $10)
- Everyone pays: $5 (50% savings!)

### 3. ✅ Stripe Connect Express
Server owners can receive payouts without a business:
- Individual accounts (no business required)
- 45+ countries supported
- Automatic daily payouts
- Direct to bank accounts

### 4. ✅ Country Selection
Users must select their country before connecting Stripe. This ensures:
- Correct account creation
- Proper bank requirements
- Compliance with local regulations

### 5. ✅ Automated Processing
Monthly cron job automatically:
- Calculates optimized amounts
- Charges pledgers
- Transfers to server owners
- Handles failures
- Sends notifications

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
Complete guides for:
- Users adding payment methods
- Server owners setting up payouts
- Administrators configuring Stripe
- Developers understanding the system

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Apply Database Changes (5 minutes)

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Apply schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Run migration script
node scripts/migrate-stripe-schema.js
```

### Step 2: Get Stripe API Keys (3 minutes)

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click **Developers** → **API keys**
4. Copy your **TEST keys**:
   - Publishable key: `pk_test_...`
   - Secret key: `sk_test_...`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (2 minutes)

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Stripe Keys (TEST MODE)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# Platform Fee (2%)
PLATFORM_FEE="0.02"

# Cron Secret (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
CRON_SECRET="your-random-secret-here"
```

### Step 4: Test Locally (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Then test:
1. ✅ Add payment method (test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
2. ✅ Connect Stripe as server owner
3. ✅ Create pledge to server
4. ✅ Manually trigger withdrawal: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/process-withdrawals`
5. ✅ Check Stripe Dashboard for test payments

### Step 5: Read Documentation (15 minutes)

Familiarize yourself with:
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Detailed installation steps
- `QUICK_START_STRIPE.md` - Quick setup guide
- `STRIPE_SETUP.md` - Full configuration guide

### Step 6: Deploy to Production (when ready)

See `STRIPE_SETUP.md` section "Going Live" for:
1. Complete Stripe verification
2. Request Connect platform approval
3. Get live API keys
4. Update production environment variables
5. Test with small real amounts

## 📋 Installation Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
node scripts/migrate-stripe-schema.js

# 2. Environment Variables
# Add to .env.local:
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# - PLATFORM_FEE
# - CRON_SECRET

# 3. Start
npm run dev

# 4. Test
# - Add payment method
# - Connect Stripe
# - Create pledge
# - Process withdrawal
```

## 🔑 Critical Implementation Details

### Off-Session Charging
**This is the most important feature:**

```typescript
// When saving card (Setup Intent)
usage: 'off_session'  // ← Allows future charges

// When charging (Payment Intent)
off_session: true  // ← Charge without user present
```

Without these flags, automatic monthly payments will **fail**.

### Stripe Connect Configuration
**Individual accounts, not business:**

```typescript
business_type: "individual"  // ← No business needed!
business_profile: {
  mcc: "8398",  // Charitable organizations
}
```

This allows server owners to receive payouts without registering a business.

### Platform Fee Structure

```
$10 Pledge:
├─ Stripe fee: ~$0.59 (2.9% + $0.30)
├─ Platform fee: $0.20 (2%)
└─ Server owner receives: ~$9.21
```

You (platform) receive $0.20 per $10 pledge.
