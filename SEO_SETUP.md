## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Create Open Graph Images**
We've generated HTML templates for you. To create the actual images:

```bash
# The HTML files are already created in /public/
# Open these files in your browser:
- public/og-image.html
- public/og-servers.html  
- public/og-members.html

# Take screenshots at 1200x630 resolution and save as:
- public/og-image.png
- public/og-servers.png
- public/og-members.png
```

### 2. **Update Google Verification**
In `app/layout.tsx`, replace this line:
```typescript
google: 'your-google-verification-code', // Replace with actual verification code
```

With your actual Google Search Console verification code.

### 3. **Update Twitter Handles**
In `app/layout.tsx`, update these lines:
```typescript
creator: '@communitypledges',  // Your Twitter handle
site: '@communitypledges',     // Your Twitter handle
```

### 4. **Add Your Logo**
Place your logo at `/public/logo.png` for the structured data.
