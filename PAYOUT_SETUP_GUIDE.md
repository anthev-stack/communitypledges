## Country Selection

### Why Country Selection Matters

Your country determines:
- 🏦 What banks you can use
- 💵 Available payout currencies
- 📋 Required verification documents
- ⏱️ Payout schedules and timing

### Changing Your Country

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Once you complete Stripe onboarding, you **CANNOT** change your country.

If you selected the wrong country:
1. **Before completing onboarding**: Go to Settings and select a new country
2. **After completing onboarding**: Contact our support team - we may need to reset your account

### VPN Users

⚠️ **Disable VPNs** when setting up Stripe Connect! Using a VPN can cause country mismatches and verification issues.

## Completing Onboarding

### Onboarding Status

Check your onboarding status in Settings:

- 🟡 **Pending** - Onboarding not complete yet
- 🟢 **Active** - Fully verified and ready to receive payouts
- 🔴 **Restricted** - Action required (check Stripe dashboard)

### Verification Timeline

- **Instant**: Most users are verified immediately
- **1-2 days**: If additional documents are needed
- **7-14 days**: Initial payout holding period (Stripe security measure)

### What If I'm Restricted?

If your account shows "Restricted":

1. Check your email from Stripe
2. Log in to your Stripe dashboard
3. See what information is missing
4. Provide the requested documents
5. Resubmit for review

Common reasons for restrictions:

## Receiving Payouts

### How Payouts Work

1. **Pledgers are charged** on your server's withdrawal day
2. **Platform fee deducted** (2% of total pledges)
3. **Stripe transfer created** to your Connect account
4. **Automatic payout** to your bank account (daily schedule)

### Payout Schedule

After initial verification:
- ✅ **Daily automatic payouts** to your bank account
- ✅ **Arrives 2-5 business days** after withdrawal day
- ✅ **Email notifications** for each payout

### Your First Payout

Your first payout takes longer due to Stripe's security measures:

- **Initial holding period**: 7-14 days
- **After that**: Normal schedule (daily payouts)

## Understanding Fees

### Fee Breakdown

When pledgers support your server, here's what happens to the money:

**Example: Server receives $100 in pledges**

| Fee Type | Amount | Goes To | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Total Pledges | $100.00 | - | What pledgers paid |
| Platform Fee (2%) | -$2.00 | Community Pledges | Platform operational costs |
| **You Receive** | **$98.00** | **You** | **Transferred to your bank** |

### Stripe Processing Fees

Stripe charges fees when collecting payments from pledgers (already included):
- **2.9% + $0.30** per transaction
- These fees are deducted from the platform's share, not yours!

### No Hidden Fees

- ✅ No setup fees
- ✅ No monthly fees
- ✅ No payout fees
- ✅ No account maintenance fees
- ✅ No minimum balance requirements

### Currency Conversion

If you're in a different country than the pledgers:

- **Conversion fees** may apply (typically 1-2%)
- Rates are competitive with banks
