## How It Works

Community Pledges uses **Stripe** to securely process your payments. Here's what happens:

1. **You save a payment method** (credit/debit card) to your account
2. **You pledge an amount** to support a game server (minimum $2)
3. **Each month**, we automatically charge your card based on the server's withdrawal day
4. **Smart optimization** may reduce your payment if the server is overfunded!

### Why Stripe?
- 🔒 **Secure**: Industry-leading security and PCI compliance
- 🌍 **Global**: Accepted worldwide
- 💳 **Easy**: No account creation needed - just save your card
- 📱 **Convenient**: Automatic monthly payments

Enter your card information:

## Understanding Smart Optimization

**What is Smart Optimization?**

Our unique algorithm adjusts your monthly payment based on how many people are supporting the server. This means **you might pay less than your pledged amount!**

### How It Works

#### Scenario 1: Server is Underfunded
- **Server Cost**: $50/month
- **Total Pledges**: $40/month (8 people × $5)
- **Result**: Everyone pays their full pledge ($5 each)
- **Server Owner Receives**: $40 (still needs $10 more)

#### Scenario 2: Server is Perfectly Funded
- **Server Cost**: $50/month
- **Total Pledges**: $50/month (10 people × $5)
- **Result**: Everyone pays their full pledge ($5 each)
- **Server Owner Receives**: $50 (exactly what's needed)

#### Scenario 3: Server is Overfunded ⭐
- **Server Cost**: $50/month
- **Total Pledges**: $100/month (20 people × $5)
- **Result**: Everyone pays 50% of their pledge ($2.50 each)
- **Server Owner Receives**: $50 (exactly what's needed)
- **Your Savings**: $2.50! 💰

### Real Example

Let's say you pledge $10/month to a server:

| Total Pledgers | Server Cost | You Pledged | You Actually Pay | You Save |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 5 people       | $50/month   | $10         | $10.00           | $0       |
| 10 people      | $50/month   | $10         | $5.00            | $5.00 💰 |
| 20 people      | $50/month   | $10         | $2.50            | $7.50 💰 |

**The more people that pledge, the less everyone pays!**

## Payment Schedule

### When Will I Be Charged?

Each server has a **withdrawal day** (1-28 of the month). You'll be charged **2 days before** that date.

**Example:**
- Server withdrawal day: 15th of the month
- Your charge date: 13th of the month

### What Happens Each Month?

1. **2 days before withdrawal day**: Your card is automatically charged
2. **Charge amount**: Based on smart optimization (may be less than your pledge!)
3. **Email confirmation**: You'll receive a receipt
4. **Funds transferred**: Money goes directly to the server owner

### Viewing Your Payment History

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Activity** tab
3. See all your past payments and amounts

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my payment information safe?
**Yes!** We use Stripe, which is trusted by millions of businesses worldwide. Your card details are encrypted and never stored on our servers. Stripe is PCI-DSS Level 1 certified (the highest security standard).

### Can I use PayPal or other payment methods?
Currently, we only accept credit and debit cards through Stripe. This ensures fast, reliable, and automatic monthly payments.

### Can I change my pledge amount?
Yes! You can update or cancel your pledge at any time from the server page.

### When will I see the charge on my statement?
Charges appear immediately after processing. Look for "COMMUNITY PLEDGES" or "STRIPE*COMMUNITYPLEDGES" on your statement.

### What's the platform fee?
We charge a 2% platform fee to cover operational costs. This is already included in the amounts shown. For example, on a $10 pledge, $0.20 goes to the platform and $9.80 goes to the server owner (minus Stripe's processing fees).

### Can I get a refund?
Payments are non-refundable as they're immediately transferred to server owners. If you have concerns, please contact the server owner or our support team.

### What if a server shuts down?
If a server becomes inactive, your pledge is automatically cancelled and you won't be charged again.

### Can I support multiple servers?
Yes! You can pledge to as many servers as you want with one payment method.

### What currencies are supported?
All pledges are in USD. If your card is in a different currency, your bank will convert it at their exchange rate.

### How do I remove my payment method?
1. Go to Settings
2. Find Payment Method section
3. Click "Remove Payment Method"
4. Confirm removal

**Note**: Removing your payment method will cancel all active pledges.

### Will I be charged immediately when I pledge?
No! Your first charge happens on the server's next withdrawal cycle. The server page shows when the next charge will occur.

### Can I set a maximum monthly amount across all pledges?
This feature is coming soon! For now, track your pledges in the Activity section.
