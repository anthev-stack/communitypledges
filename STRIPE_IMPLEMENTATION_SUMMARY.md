## 🔄 Payment Flow

### For Pledgers (Making Payments)

1. User adds payment method via Setup Intent
2. Card is saved for off_session use
3. User pledges amount to server
4. On withdrawal day, card is automatically charged
5. Amount may be reduced by optimization algorithm
6. User receives email confirmation

### For Server Owners (Receiving Payouts)

1. Owner selects country (cannot change later)
2. Owner connects Stripe Connect Express
3. Completes onboarding (ID, bank account, etc.)
4. When withdrawal day arrives, platform charges pledgers
5. Platform deducts 2% fee
6. Remaining amount transferred to owner's Connect account
7. Stripe automatically pays out to owner's bank (daily)

### Money Flow

```
Pledger's Card
  ↓
Stripe Payment Intent ($10.00)
  ↓ (minus Stripe fee: $0.59)
Platform ($9.41)
  ↓ (minus 2% platform fee: $0.19)
Transfer to Connect Account ($9.22)
  ↓ (automatic payout)
Server Owner's Bank
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Stripe Dashboard

Monitor these regularly:

1. **Payments** - All payment intents (pledger charges)
2. **Connect** - Connected accounts (server owners)
3. **Transfers** - Money sent to server owners
4. **Payouts** - Platform fees being paid out

### Database Monitoring

Key queries to watch:

```sql
-- Failed payments
SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE "failedPayments" > 0;

-- Incomplete onboarding
SELECT * FROM "User" 
WHERE "stripeAccountId" IS NOT NULL 
AND "stripeOnboardingComplete" = false;

-- Active pledges
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Pledge" WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';

-- Recent withdrawals
SELECT * FROM "Withdrawal" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔒 Security

### API Keys

- ✅ Never commit to git
- ✅ Use environment variables only
- ✅ Different keys for dev/prod
- ✅ Rotate if compromised

### Payment Methods

- ✅ Never store raw card numbers
- ✅ Only store Stripe tokens
- ✅ Use Setup Intent for saving cards
- ✅ Enable off_session for automatic charges

### Connect Accounts

- ✅ Verify country before creating
- ✅ Check onboarding completion before transfers
- ✅ Handle account restrictions gracefully

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Cannot charge payment method"
**Cause:** Payment method not saved with off_session capability
**Fix:** Use Setup Intent (already implemented)

### "Country mismatch"
**Cause:** User's Stripe account country doesn't match selected country
**Fix:** Delete and recreate account (already handled in code)

### "Transfer failed"
**Cause:** Connected account not fully onboarded
**Fix:** Check `stripeOnboardingComplete` before transfers (already implemented)

### "Payment declined"
**Cause:** Card issue (expired, insufficient funds, etc.)
**Fix:** Notify user, increment failure counter, suspend after 3 failures (already implemented)
